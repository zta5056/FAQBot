# FAQBot

W7 Group Assignment : Agents Development using OpenAI
Project Title: FAQ Bot using OpenAI Agent Builder
Group Members: Hailey Kapasi, Zachary Annuik

Project Scope and Objectives 

For this assignment, our group created a simple yet functional FAQ Bot using OpenAI’s Agent Builder. The primary goal of this agent is to automate responses to commonly asked questions from customers, such as business hours, return policies, or how to reach support. This kind of automation helps reduce the repetitive workload on human employees and ensures users get immediate answers 24/7 without needing to wait for someone to respond manually.
 
The project is designed to demonstrate how low-code/no-code AI tools like OpenAI’s Agent Builder can be used to quickly develop functional assistants without any programming experience. Our objective was not just to build a chatbot, but to explore the process of planning, configuring, and testing an OpenAI-powered workflow that solves a real-world business problem.
 
This FAQ Bot is especially useful for small businesses, e-commerce platforms, or campus organizations that may not have dedicated customer service teams. It offers a scalable and easily maintainable solution, where answers can be updated or customized at any time by editing the agent’s instruction panel. It also provides a safe, controlled AI experience since it only responds based on predefined questions and answers, minimizing the risk of hallucinated or inappropriate responses.
 
Through this project, we aimed to understand the practical steps involved in building an OpenAI agent, learn how to structure clear prompts and instructions, and reflect on the potential of generative AI to automate everyday interactions in a reliable and ethical way.





Team Roles 

Zach: Set up the Agent Builder interface, added FAQ instructions, tested the bot, took screenshots, and created the GitHub repo.

Hailey: Wrote the documentation, explained use case and setup, included ethical considerations, formatted the final submission.
